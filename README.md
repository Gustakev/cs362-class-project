# iExtract iOS Album to Folder Conversion Tool

## Project Overview
iExtract makes it easy for iPhone users to back up their photos and videos to local storage without breaking albumns, folders, or metadata. Instead of having to rely on expensive cloud subscriptions or confusing export workflows, iExtract preserves the original organization of user's photos.

## Goal of our app
* Provdide a fast and intuitive export process for IOS media
* Preserve album/folder structure during exports
* Maintain metadata (dates, locations, file types, etc)
* Reduce dependency on iCloud storage
* Avoids quality loss through compression

## Respository Layout

- We have a folder called "living documents" where it stores our document of our app that explains, our app idea along with all the requirements

- We have a "reports" folder that holds weekly progress reports for our project. Each report would contain a our weekly status update from our TA, and our individual contributions of each team member
