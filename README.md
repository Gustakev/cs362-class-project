# iExtract iOS Album to Folder Conversion Tool

## Project Overview
iExtract makes it easy for iPhone users to extract their photos and videos from a local backup to somewhere else on their local storage without breaking album and collection structure or metadata. Instead of having to rely on expensive cloud subscriptions or confusing export workflows, iExtract preserves the original organization of a user's photos, without the bloat or cost of other monolithic apps.

## Goal of Our App
* Provide a fast and intuitive export process for iOS media using a backup as the source
* Preserve album/collection structure during exports
* Maintain metadata (dates, locations, file types, etc.)
* Reduce dependency on iCloud storage
* Avoid quality loss that typically occurs through compression of files during epxorts using other tools
