## Team Report:
**TA Feedback**

* N/A

**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Ensure that the BackupModel can be created, at least without all metadata, and that full extractions can be done. (3 days)
* Continue training AI bot to photo caption. (daily)
* Upload beta version of AI bot and sample pics for beta version. (1 day)
* Create test cases for any new features. (1 day)
  
**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* BackupModel can be fully made with metadata.
* Extraction engine prototype has been worked on.

*Issues:*
* The BackupModel can't be fully extracted from yet.
* The menu options haven't yet been finalized.

**Plans/Goals For Next Week**


Note: Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.
* Finish the Extraction Engine for mass export. (2 days)
* Finish the Extraction Engine for export of specific collections. (2 days)
* Finish integration of the blacklist/whitelist system from main menu. (2 days)

### Kevin Gustafson:

**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Finish BackupModel creation (get it working for the backups that we have). (2 days)
* Test various iPhone model backups across various versions from iOS 26.2 onward. (3 days)
* Get started on the file extraction engine. (1 day)

**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* Backups of an iPhone 14 (iOS 26.2) and an iPhone SE 2nd Gen (iOS 26.2.1) can be loaded into the BackupModel object.

*Issues:*
* The ways that Photos.sqlite and Manifest.db are set up differs across iPhone models, and perhaps iOS versions, though we are not sure about that assertion yet. The SQL command facilitator must be refined to ensure all iPhone backups from iOS 26 and beyond can be loaded successfully, without error.
* File Extraction Engine has not been implemented yet. Planning has been done.
