### Kevin Gustafson:

**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Finish BackupModel creation (get it working for the backups that we have). (2 days)
* Test various iPhone model backups across various versions from iOS 26.2 onward. (3 days)
* Get started on the file extraction engine. (1 day)

**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* Backups of an iPhone 14 (iOS 26.2) and an iPhone SE 2nd Gen (iOS 26.2.1) can be loaded into the BackupModel object.

*Issues:*
* The ways that Photos.sqlite and Manifest.db are set up differs across iPhone models, and perhaps iOS versions, though we are not sure about that assertion yet. The SQL command facilitator must be refined to ensure all iPhone backups from iOS 26 and beyond can be loaded successfully, without error.
