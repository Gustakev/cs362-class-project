# Week 6 Report (February 8 - February 14)

## Team Report:
**TA Feedback**

N/A

**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Present the midterm presentation. (1 day)
* Get started on the app's code for loading the backup and creating a logical data structure to store backup information. (2 days)
* Test the first iteration of the loading system. (1 day)
* Keep working on the training loop to get started on training for our AI model to auto generate captions from user photos.
  
**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* The BackupModel data structure has been finalized.
* Backups can be loaded and their essential information can be displayed.
* We successfully presented.
* The AI image description tool has improved in quality.

*Issues:*
* The backup loader is not yet complete. It can only list information about a backup, not its contents.
* The main menu has not yet been completed, in terms of the additional options shown in the presentation.

**Plans/Goals For Next Week**


Note: Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.
* Finish the backup loading system completely, ensuring that it successfully loads all relevant data into the BackupModel object. (3 days)
* Test the backup loading system with our testing suite. (2 days)
* Get the rest of the main menu of the CLI finished, in terms of its skeleton, not the functionality of features that haven't been hooked up to it yet. (2 days)

## Individual Contributions:

### Sam Daughtry:
  
**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Work on the backend code of the project. (3 days)
* Present presentation. (1 day)

**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* Started designing the skeleton code for the photo conversion feature
* Researched into what python libraries would be helpful for converting types

*Issues:*
* N/A

**Plans/Goals For Next Week**


Note: Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.
* Implement the file conversion feature (2 days)
* Start working on the mass album/collection features (3 days)

### Noah Gregie:
  
**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Create mockup for potential GUI. (1 day)
* Do more research on CLI implementation: adding progress bars and easy to read display. (2 days)
* Complete midterm presenation slides. (1 day)

**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* Found Textual Python library that creates a gui built into the terminal. Translated our existing basic CLI into textual code and got basic button logic working.
* Textual library uses CSS to style its format, so I need to familiarize myself with CSS
  

*Issues:*
* Currently stuck on translating the backup loader function, where it verifies that the backup is indeed a valid Apple backup

**Plans/Goals For Next Week**


Note: Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.
* Implement a complete CLI for all menu options (2 days)
     * White listing menu ( 1 day)
     * Black listing menu ( 1 day)
     * Help menu ( 1 day)
     * Settings menu ( 1 day)
* Start coming up with tests for our existing code for the test suite ( 3 days)
         

### Kevin Gustafson:

**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Get started on the app's code for loading the backup and creating a logical data structure to store backup information. (2 days)

**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* Designed the method to create a BackupModel object based on a selected backup.
* Implemented the BackupModel data structure and the code that loads the basic information about a backup.

*Issues:*
* Keeping the API for the backup loading method compatible with the CLI has been slightly difficult because our scope may change.

**Plans/Goals For Next Week**


Note: Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.
* Ensure that all of our test backups can be loaded and displayed with album/collection names (basic BackupModel object creation works (not yet including major details, only which items are in the collections/albums and the items' creation dates)). (3 days)
* Add missing menu options, relative to the presentation we gave. (2 days)
* Ensure that the added menu options are well-made and functional. (2 days)

### Brendon Wong:
  
**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Continue working on training loop to start training iterations.
* Discuss how we can start backend development.

**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* Trained AI model to write a legible caption for photos

*Issues:*
* Captions aren't relevent
* Training iterations aren't improving the model
* Changing hyperparameters aren't doing anything to the model

**Plans/Goals For Next Week**


Note: Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.
* Continue training to model for better output
* Decide if I still want to train the model or switch the AI logic
* Create test suites for backup_locator
