**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Present the midterm presentation. (1 day)
* Get started on the app's code for loading the backup and creating a logical data structure to store backup information. (2 days)
* Test the first iteration of the loading system. (1 day)
* Keep working on the training loop to get started on training for our AI model to auto generate captions from user photos.
  
**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

**Plans/Goals For Next Week**


Note: Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.

### Kevin Gustafson:

**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Get started on the app's code for loading the backup and creating a logical data structure to store backup information. (2 days)

**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* Designed the method to create a BackupModel object based on a selected backup.

*Issues:*
* Keeping the API for the backup loading method compatible with the CLI has been slightly difficult because our scope may change.

**Plans/Goals For Next Week**


Note: Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.
* Ensure that all of our test backups can be loaded and displayed with album/collection names (basic BackupModel object creation works (not yet including major details, only which images are in the collections and albums and the images' creation dates)).

### Brendon Wong:
  
**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Continue working on training loop to start training iterations
* Discuss how we can start backend development.
