# Week 5 Report (February 1 - February 7)

## Team Report:
**TA Feedback**

N/A

**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Figure out the architecture of iExtract. (2 days)
* Get started on the UI mockup. (3 days)
* Create the rest of the test cases. (3 days)
* Start training the AI model. (1 day (to start))
* Work on the midterm presentation. (2 days)
  
**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* Determined the architecture/pattern of iExtract, as well as the directory structure of the app.
* Created a working minimal CLI UI, demonstrating how the user experience will be.
* More test cases have been created.
* The AI training has been started.
* Work on the midterm presentation will be completed by the end of Sunday.

*Issues:*
* Determining the architecture was difficult, as there are a few different ones that could have been good choices. However, we decided to go with the Layered Pattern, which allows us to have a clean separation of concerns amongst the files for each component in our program.

**Plans/Goals For Next Week**


Note: Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.
* Present the midterm presentation. (1 day)
* Get started on the app's code for loading the backup and creating a logical data structure to store backup information. (3 days)
* Test the first iteration of the loading system. (1 day)

### Noah Gregie:
  
**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Work on project presentation-question 3. (3 days)
* Clarify project architecture (1 day)
* Reevaluate project risks (1 day)

**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* basic outline for presentation 

*Issues:*
* Figuring out project architectures is a little tricky.

* Finish Presentation:
  - Create basic script outline. (3 days)
  - Create slides and include pictures. ( 3 days)

### Kevin Gustafson:

**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Definitively determine the program architecture that we will be using. (2 days)
* Finalize the repo structure. (2 days)
* Finalize the weekly report format. (2 days)

**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* The program architecture, Layered, has been chosen.
* The repo structure has been finalized.
* We are ready to begin development.
* The weekly report format is stable and consistent.

*Issues:*
* Determining the exact units of abstraction that we needed to add to our living document was very hard.
  - I ended up making more general units of abstraction, rather than hyper-specific ones that we may not even use.
