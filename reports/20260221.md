# Week 7 Report (February 15 - 21)

## Team Report:
**TA Feedback**

N/A

**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Finish the backup loading system completely, ensuring that it successfully loads all relevant data into the BackupModel object. (3 days)
* Test the backup loading system with our testing suite. (2 days)
* Get the rest of the main menu of the CLI finished, in terms of its skeleton, not the functionality of features that haven't been hooked up to it yet. (2 days)
  
**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* CLI functionality has been recompartmentalized and a future GUI has been mocked up.

*Issues:*
* It is taking longer than expected to get the backup loading system working. It is complicated, and the team has a lot of things to deal with in other aspects of their lives, so it has been hard to make time to finish the loading system and then test it within 1 week.

**Plans/Goals For Next Week**


Note: Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.

### Noah Gregie:
  
**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Implement remaining CLI implementations
    * White Listing (1 day)
    * Black Listing (1 day)
    * Settings menu (1 day)
    * Help menu (1 day)

**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* Implemented the settings menu that allows for white listing and black listing
* Converted the basic CLI menu into a Textual format to see if it is feasible/ something that we want to do

*Issues:*
* Existing backuploader menu function might violate layered architecture guidelines, need to reclarify with the group

**Plans/Goals For Next Week**
* Create test cases for the main menu ( 3 days)
* Make sure that every sub-menu or menu of our software is implemented ( 1 day )

Note: Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.

### Kevin Gustafson:

**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Ensure that all of our test backups can be loaded and displayed with album/collection names (basic BackupModel object creation works (not yet including major details, only which items are in the collections/albums and the items' creation dates)). (3 days)
* Add missing menu options, relative to the presentation we gave. (2 days)
* Ensure that the added menu options are well-made and functional. (2 days)

**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* Fixed some menu options that were inconsistent stylistically.

*Issues:*
* Understanding the backup and using SQLite to build a BackupModel has been harder than expected.

**Plans/Goals For Next Week**


Note: Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.
* Finish BackupModel creation system. (3 days)

### Brendon Wong:
  
**Plans/Goals For This Week**
* Continue training to model for better output
* Decide if I still want to train the model or switch the AI logic
* Create test suites for backup_locator

**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* Added to User Documentation
* Continue training our photo captioning bot and have added more to the dataset to get better results.
* Created test suites for backup_locator

*Issues:*
* Still can't get good results for photo captioning bot.
