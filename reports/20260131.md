# Week 4 Report (January 25 - January 31)

## Team Report:
**TA Feedback**

Review the system architecture website provided in class modules to finalize which system architecture we should do for our project. Update our current system architecture document to match one of the listed system architecture's from the website.

**Goals From Last Week**
* Finalize presentation slides.
* Come up with quarter long development process.
* Brainstorm ideas to provide a schedule for each member with a measureable milestone for each week.
* Have an initial UI/UX design idea that has user flow path.
* Have a drafted test case for features 1 and 2.
* Have a regression test sheet.
* Have a skeleton code for all our features and the main app.
  
**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* The main menu UI has been drafted, with code available as the example (main_menu.py).
* Team roles have been discussed.
* The presentation was done.

*Issues:*
* We are still determining the exact architecture of the app that we wish to use. It is hard to be sure early on, as it has taken a couple of weeks to even understand what kinds of functionality the program must be capable of. This has made it hard to determine the architecture to use, as that determination is based on what best fits a certain kind of project with given goals.

**Plans/Goals for This Week**


Note: Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.
* Figure out the architecture of iExtract. (2 days)
* Designate team roles. (2 days)
* Get started on the UI mockup. (3 days)
* Create tests. (3 days)

## Individual Contributions:

### Sam Daughtry:
  
**Goals From Last Week**
* Refamiliarize myself with Python

**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* Reviewed python's documentation
* Contributed to deciding our system architecture

*Issues:*
* We have yet to determine what system architecture to use

**Plans/Goals for This Week**


Note: Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.
* Draft ideas for how our projects backend will be designed (2 days)
* Finialize our system architecture (2 days)

### Noah Gregie:
  
**Goals From Last Week**
* Figure out how to find Apple created albums and collections and use Python to extract them. (2 days)

**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* Found Apple created albums. Found different people and favorites.

*Issues:*
* Most Apple created albums do not have names, which makes finding them difficult. The different Apple created albums and collections can be mapped, but it must be done dynamically.

* N/A

### Kevin Gustafson:

**Goals From Last Week**
* Clarify the main structure/flow of the CLI and the main features to implement by the end of Week 3. (3 days)
* Help implement the features that are to be completed by the end of Week 3, such as the minimum CLI functionality and the ability to list all the albums and/or collections on a user's device. (3 days)

**Progress + Issues**


Note: What you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

*Progress:*
* The general structure and flow of the CLI has been determined, as a mockup CLI has been coded already, which may be modified later, but it serves as a draft.

*Issues:*
* Code is not meant to be final yet.
* It is hard to determine which specific kind of architecture we want to use at this point because we don't know exactly how the app will work, in terms of program logic.

Note: Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.
* Definitively determine the program architecture that we will be using. (2 days)
* Finalize the repo structure. (2 days)
* Finalize the weekly report format. (2 days)

### Brendon Wong:
  
**Goals From Last Week**
* Start reviewing all use cases and how they tie into the major features
* Start drafting test cases for use cases 1 and 2
* Start preparing a regression test sheet

**Progress + Issues**

*Progress:*
* Created a regression test sheet and listed all our features
* Created 3 test cases
* Helped decide on the system architecture
* Found and processed data to train our AI model for our app

*Issues:*
* Understaning the formatting requirements for our reports.

**Plans/Goals for This Week**

* Finish creating test cases for the remaining features
* Help finialize the document for the system architecture
* Create test loop to train our AI model
